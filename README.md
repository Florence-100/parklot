This repository contains code for the Carpark Prediction Project. 

Currently, the codes for training Seq2Seq, DCRNN and GTS models to predict carpark availability for the Nottingham and San Francisco datasets are stored in the 
respective model files. Further information can be found in the Readme files in the respective folders. 

Nottingham dataset can be accessed from https://gitlab.com/dhstolfi/predicting-car-park-occupancy-rates-in-smart-cities
San Francisco dataset can be accessed from https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/YLWCSU
